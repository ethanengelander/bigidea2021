                When I was younger I decided I would see what happens if I could roll down the stairs. I cracked my head
                open and had to go to the hospital. I also one tried to open a door but lost grip on the handle and then
                cracked my head open again. I also one tripped up when I was younger and knocked my two front teeth back
                into my gum and knocked out two others.

                started to learn 5 instruments
                but
                after a some time stopped lessons for each one of them. The instruments were Violin, Cello,
                Trombone, Singing, Piano. I like to think I could pick any of them up and still give it a good go but I
                know I have probably forgotten almost everything. I stopped most of them because I was never any good
                but in Israel I've had no time anyway</div>

                religious shul service of a friend's barmitzvah I decidded it would be a good idea to play football at
                the front of this shul to
                pass the time with some friends. We one of those rubber beach balls. I was very out of practice and one
                time when I tried to pass the ball I put my foot on the ball and tripped over. I shattered my Ulna and
                badly bent the radius in my arm. I never made it to Shabbat lunch and missed the function. Luckily I was
                out of the cast by my own barmitzvah.</div>

                role as Captain Hook in school when I was 12. During the second night I swung my hooked hand
                backwards so fast I lost grip on the prop and sent it flying across the room to hit an audience member.
                In an attempt to salvage something I hooked my finger and said my remaining line and quickly ran off the
                stage before people saw I broke character. I was called Captain Hookless for ages.

                semi final match of the U16 basketball tournament I got confused after my team mate missed his second
                free-throw. I was so excited about winning the rebound that I immediately did a lay up and was happy
                that I scored until I realised it was an offensive free-throw. I was subbed off immediately and didn't
                play for the remaining few minutes. We were well ahead and won the game ny about 10 points. </div>

                appointment at Maccabi for an injury I ran in and put my Maccabi card in to the machine. When I realised
                it wasn't showing my appointment I went to the receptionist who didn't speake great English and tried to
                explain. 5 minutes of miscommunication later another receptionist came down the reception and asked what
                my appointment was for and when I told her she asked why I was in Maccabi dentist for an injury.</div>
