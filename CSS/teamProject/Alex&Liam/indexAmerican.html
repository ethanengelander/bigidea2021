           <p class='pHeaderA'>Inventing the Chick-fil-A® Chicken Sandwich</p>
            <p class='pTextA'>
            Serving a breaded, boneless chicken breast between two buttered buns is a seemingly simple idea--but it was a novelty for its time. Truett Cathy experimented for years at the Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, GA when in 1964, he finally arrived at the perfect recipe. On that day, the Chick-fil-A® Chicken Sandwich was born. That capital A is on purpose – it means "grade A top quality". Truett's customers told him, "We like it, don't change it again." And we haven't.

            <p class='pHeaderA'>Why They're Closed on Sundays</p>
            <p class='pTextA'>
                "Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. Having worked seven days a week in restaurants open 24 hours, Truett saw the importance of closing on Sundays so that he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose — a practice we uphold today.

                Most Chick-fil-A® restaurants operate between the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, with breakfast served from 6 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and lunch and dinner served from 10:30 a.m. until 10 p.m."

                The Daily Beast reported that the National Christian Charitable Foundation (NCF) has bankrolled opposition to The Equality Act, which would expand civil protections for LGBTQ people. The report identified Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy as one of the group's "high-dollar donors."

                The NCF is the sixth largest charity in the US and it donates to thousands of organizations. Among those are groups fighting legislation to protect LGBTQ rights, including the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom. The ADF and the Heritage Foundation both strongly oppose the Equality Act, and have supported attempts to ban transgender athletes from youth sports.
