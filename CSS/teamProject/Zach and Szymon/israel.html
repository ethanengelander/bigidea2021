                New Deli is an indian style fast food chain which focuses on sanwhiches. It offers meat sadwhiches which
                are customizable at a low price for israel, 25 â‚ª. It also sells fries which are ok as fuel for coding
                lessons. We reccomend splurging the extra 10 shekels on the sandwhich to get the Philly Steak, it's
                totally worth it.

        <div class="item shukh ">
            <div class="title">Machnei Yehudah</div>
            <div class="introshukh">The Jeruslem shukh is the term for an unpredictable variety of people, fresh
                food shops, spices and restaurants of cultures from around the world cooked and served by Israeli
                people. You can
                either
                buy an apple in a store or walk a few shops down and pay four times the price to have someone blend it
                in a juicer and serve it in a cup.

                    <div class="freshtxt">There are some shops selling that healthy colourful stuff for a pretty
                        reasonable
                        price in the shukh. You can usually barter the price down if you think a few shekels are worth
                        your time.</div>

                    <div class="nutstxt">Salted nuts and addictively spicy powders are all around the shukh. These tend
                        to be very
                        over priced but also very good quality. You feel like you're buying from a pirate when they're
                        scooping it out of a barrel.</div>

                    <div class="peopletxt">The shukh can be a very crowded place. It's unclear whether it's indoors or
                        outdoors but people smoke there. The crowds show Jerusalem's demand to eat healthy local food.

                        also meat. There's also juice shops, sweet shops, restaurants selling street food, sushi or a
                        shwarma. Whatever you want to eat the Shukh has it.</div>

            <img src="images/ettttrog.jpg" class=etrog>
            <div class="etrogtxt">Much like New Deli, etrog man's smoothies have cult like popularity in Jerusalem. They
                are dotted around the city with much competition from other smoothie places. They serve smoothies and
                take pricing out of Apple's playbook, going from a 3 shekel shot of juice to over 50 for a freshly made
                shake with mix ins. The only comparison in popularity is Golda Ice cream in Tel Aviv. <br><br> They also
                sell skin products made from etrog which are apparently good for your skin. I just think they're trying
                to find a use for all the etrog's after Succot. If you're particularly unlucky they'll spray you in the
                face with some etrog juice and insist it's good for your skin. It's a lovely treat to get sprayed in the
                face.</div>

            <div class="title">Israeli Health Tea</div>
            <div class="teatxt">Some place I had dinner at had an amazing tea called israeli health tea. I've googled it
                and apparently it's not a real thing. It was really good though so I think it should become a thing.
                It's a cinnamon stick, mint leaves, apple, orange and honey. When it's good it is on the same level as
                Chicken soup at kicking colds. Drink this and you can try convince yourself you're embracing israeli
                culture.</div>

                <div class="hummouscode">Hummous is a staple all over the world but Jerusalem is the Capital of Hummous.
                    Some people say it's just Tahini, Olive oil, lemon, chickpeas and parsley. These people will never find love
                    or hapiness. If you want to cause chaos ask a group of people where the best hummous place is and
                    watch the argument become insulting on a personal level, abusive and violent.

                    Spirulina is a dried and processed algae Israel produces a very large amount of. For dried lake goo
                    it's incredibly healthy for you. It has more calcium than milk without any of the sugar, so a plant
                    is better at being milk than milk is. It comes as a tub of expensive powder you sprinkle in food.
                    Will you notice a difference to your life from this stuff? Probably not. But you will probably feel
                    better for doing something healthy for yourself.
