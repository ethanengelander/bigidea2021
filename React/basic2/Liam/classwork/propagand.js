          <p>I do not have one particular favorite game but some of my favorites are these:</p>
          <p>When I was little I started with call of duty BO2. That was the greatest cod game of all time and no other cod games can beat it. I also like to play Overwatch and GTA with my friends. In gta we sell drugs and kill cops its very fun.</p>
          <p> Recently I have been playing Smash Bro's. My best character in smash is Kazuya. Zach has a nintendo here and we play smash sometimes but he does not have kazuya. If he were to get kazuya id slap everyone here back to preschool.  </p>
