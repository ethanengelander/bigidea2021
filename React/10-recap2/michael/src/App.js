        So far in Israel, I have had a very positive experience. While there have been issues, overall I have enjoyed my time here.
        The land is very interesting, and it is fun to see all the history scattered around the country.
        In Jerusalem, particularly the Old City, I feel like there is a spiritual uniqueness about the place.
        The Western Wall specifically is a very spiritual experience to be near for me.
        Aside from sprituality, Jerusalem overall has a very unique aesthetic and atmosphere when compared to other cities,
        and it is cool to experience it firsthand and see what the place has to offer.
